# cf_shader_directory

Category: [graphics](/api_reference?id=graphics)  
GitHub: [cute_graphics.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_graphics.h)  
---

Sets up the app's shader directory.

```cpp
void cf_shader_directory(const char* path);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
path | A virtual path to the folder with your shaders (subfolders supported). See [Virtual File System](https://randygaul.github.io/cute_framework/#/topics/virtual_file_system).

## Remarks

Shaders can `#include` each other as long as they exist in this directory. Changes to shaders on disk
may also be watched via [cf_shader_on_changed](/graphics/cf_shader_on_changed.md) to support shader reloading during development. If you call [cf_shader_directory](/graphics/cf_shader_directory.md) with
the path `"/assets/shaders"`, you should then supply paths to [cf_make_shader](/graphics/cf_make_shader.md) relative to the shader directory, and
simply pass in paths such as `"/shader.vert`" or `"shader.frag"`. This also applies to `#include` between shaders.
