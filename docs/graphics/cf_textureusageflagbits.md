Bitmask flags that indicate the intended usage of a texture.

## Values

Enum | Description
--- | ---
TEXTURE_USAGE_SAMPLER_BIT | The texture will be used as a sampler in shaders.
TEXTURE_USAGE_COLOR_TARGET_BIT | The texture will be used as a color render target.
TEXTURE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_TARGET_BIT | The texture will be used as a depth or stencil render target.
TEXTURE_USAGE_GRAPHICS_STORAGE_READ_BIT | The texture will be used as read-only storage in graphics pipelines.
TEXTURE_USAGE_COMPUTE_STORAGE_READ_BIT | The texture will be used as read-only storage in compute pipelines.
TEXTURE_USAGE_COMPUTE_STORAGE_WRITE_BIT | The texture will be used as writeable storage in compute pipelines.

## Remarks

These flags define how a texture will be utilized in graphics and compute pipelines.
Multiple flags can be combined using a bitwise OR operation.
