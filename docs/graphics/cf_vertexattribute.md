# CF_VertexAttribute

Category: [graphics](/api_reference?id=graphics)  
GitHub: [cute_graphics.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_graphics.h)  
---

Describes the memory layout of vertex attributes.

Struct Members | Description
--- | ---
`const char* name` | The name of the vertex attribute as it appears in the shader.
`CF_VertexFormat format` | The layout in memory of one vertex. See [CF_VertexFormat](/graphics/cf_vertexformat.md).
`int offset` | The offset in memory from the beginning of a vertex to this attribute.

## Remarks

An attribute is a component of a vertex, usually one, two, three or four floats/integers. A vertex is an input
to a vertex shader. A [CF_Mesh](/graphics/cf_mesh.md) is a collection of vertices and attribute layout definitions.
