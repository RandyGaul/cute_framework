The [Cute Framework](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/tree/master/samples) samples are hosted on GitHub alongside the source code. Some of the samples using Cute Framework's C API, while some use the C++ API. Make sure to note if you're looking at one or the other! The main difference between each API is in C there are no namespaces, so most names are prepended with `cf_`.
