# cf_coroutine_currently_running

Category: [coroutine](/api_reference?id=coroutine)  
GitHub: [cute_coroutine.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_coroutine.h)  
---

Returns the opaque pointer to the coroutine currently running.

```cpp
CF_Coroutine cf_coroutine_currently_running();
```

## Remarks

Each coroutine has ther `co` pointer handed to them as the only parameter in [CF_CoroutineFn](/coroutine/cf_coroutinefn.md), so you likely
already have access to the coroutine pointer. However, this function is made available here for convenience.
For example, your coroutines may call into other functions -- instead of passing around a `co` pointer everywhere,
your helper functions can simply fetch the [CF_Coroutine](/coroutine/cf_coroutine.md) pointer themselves on an as-needed basis by calling
this function.
