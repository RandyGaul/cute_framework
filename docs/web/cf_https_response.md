# cf_https_response

Category: [web](/api_reference?id=web)  
GitHub: [cute_https.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_https.h)  
---

Returns a [CF_HttpsResponse](/web/cf_httpsresponse.md) from a request.

```cpp
CF_HttpsResponse cf_https_response(CF_HttpsRequest request);
```

## Remarks

A response can be retrieved from the `https` object after `cf_https_state` returns `CF_HTTPS_STATE_COMPLETED`.
Calling this function otherwise will get you a NULL pointer returned. This will get cleaned up automatically
when [cf_https_destroy](/web/cf_https_destroy.md) is called.
