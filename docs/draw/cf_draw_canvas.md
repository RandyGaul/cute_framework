Draws a canvas.

```cpp
void cf_draw_canvas(CF_Canvas canvas, CF_V2 position, CF_V2 scale);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
canvas | The canvas to draw.
position | The position to draw at.
scale | The scale of the canvas, w/h.

## Remarks

This function creates an entire dedicated draw call internally. This means it's a fairly expensive
function, so be sure to use it sparingly.
