# cf_render_layers_to

Category: [draw](/api_reference?id=draw)  
GitHub: [cute_draw.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_draw.h)  
---

Renders to a [CF_Canvas](/graphics/cf_canvas.md) between a lo/hi range (inclusive).

```cpp
void cf_render_layers_to(CF_Canvas canvas, int layer_lo, int layer_hi, bool clear);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
canvas | The canvas to render to.
layer_lo | The layer to start rendering with.
layer_hi | The layer to stop rendering after.
clear | If true the canvas gets cleared before rendering.

## Remarks

Renders a range of layers to a canvas. All `draw_` functions called on other layers will not be executed. Everything queued up between
`layer_lo` and `layer_hi` will get processed and rendered to the canvas, and then removed from the internal command queue (won't be rendered again later).
