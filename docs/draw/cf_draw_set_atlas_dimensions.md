# cf_draw_set_atlas_dimensions

Sets the internal atlas size for batching sprites. The default is 2048x2048.

```cpp
void cf_draw_set_atlas_dimensions(int width_in_pixels, int height_in_pixels);
```

## Remarks

This function will completely invalidate the current cache, causing a noticeable perf cost -- do not call this
function frequently. It's intended as a one-time setup. Be careful not to pass in values too large as certain
graphics backends have different texture size limits. A very safe max size is 2048x2048 (the default), but you
can likely get away with 4096 on most devices. Larger internal atlases can be useful to decrease the number of
draw calls used, and also enables support for high-res image rendering.

Please not you should put in power of 2 atlases sizes to make the hardware happy. Here are the recommended range
of sizes available:

- 256
- 512
- 1024
- 2048
- 4096
