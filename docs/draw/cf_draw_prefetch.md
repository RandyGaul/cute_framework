Prefetches a sprite.

```cpp
void cf_draw_prefetch(const CF_Sprite* sprite);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
sprite | The sprite.

## Remarks

This function ensures the sprite is fully loaded into memory without actually rendering anything.
This is a good way to avoid disk io at inconvenient times.
