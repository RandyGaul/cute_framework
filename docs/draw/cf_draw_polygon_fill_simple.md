# cf_draw_polygon_fill_simple

Category: [draw](/api_reference?id=draw)  
GitHub: [cute_draw.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_draw.h)  
---

Draws a filled polygon.

```cpp
void cf_draw_polygon_fill_simple(CF_V2* points, int count);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
points | An array of points to define the polygon surface.
count | The number of points in the polygon.

## Remarks

Unlike [cf_draw_polygon_fill](/draw/cf_draw_polygon_fill.md), this function can render a higher number of vertices than 8. However, the polygon
must be a _simple polygon_, meaning no self-intersections are allowed, no duplicate or overlapping vertices are
allowed, and other features like chubbiness or antialias can not be applied. This function simply converts your
polygon and renders a series of triangles under the hood. Please be sure to submit your vertices in CCW order.
