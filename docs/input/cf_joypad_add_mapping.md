# cf_joypad_add_mapping

Category: [input](/api_reference?id=input)

Adds an SDL2 mapping to the joypad system.

```cpp
CF_Result cf_joypad_add_mapping(const char* mapping);
```

## Remarks

For each valid mapping string added, another kind of joypad is supported.
Cute Framework automatically initializes many mappings from the community organized mapping
database on GitHub (https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB), so you probably don't need
to ever call this function.
