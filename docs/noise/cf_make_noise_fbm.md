# cf_make_noise_fbm

Category: [noise](/api_reference?id=noise)  
GitHub: [cute_noise.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_noise.h)  
---

Returns a [CF_Noise](/noise/cf_noise.md) for generating noise at specified points using fractal brownian motion.

```cpp
CF_Noise cf_make_noise_fbm(uint64_t seed, float scale, float lacunarity, int octaves, float falloff);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
seed | Used to seed the sequence of numbers generated. Default 0.
scale | Scales up or down the noise in the image, like zooming in or out. Default 1.0f.
lacunarity | The difference in the period of the noise between each octave. Default 2.0f.
octaves | The number of octaves to sum together. Higher numbers has worse performance. Default 3.
falloff | How much contribution higher octaves have compared to lower ones. Default 0.5f.

## Remarks

You're probably looking for image generation functions such as [cf_noise_pixels](/noise/cf_noise_pixels.md) or [cf_noise_fbm_pixels](/noise/cf_noise_fbm_pixels.md). This
function is fairly low-level and intended for those who know what they're doing.
