    Overview:

        Shader program 'shader':
            Get shader desc: color_fill_shader_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_color_fill_vs_in_pos = 0
                    ATTR_color_fill_vs_in_col = 1
            Fragment shader: fs


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader shader = sg_make_shader(color_fill_shader_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_color_fill_vs_in_pos] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_color_fill_vs_in_col] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]
